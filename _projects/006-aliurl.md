[aliurl](https://github.com/ivabus/aliurl) is "dynamic" URL "aliaser" (router), that could be managed via POST requests.

[urouter](https://github.com/ivabus/urouter) is "static" URL router, that reads route list in compile-time.

Both of them are built on top of [Rocket.rs](https://rocket.rs) framework.

Aliurl powers [ивабус.рф](https://ивабус.рф) and urouter powers [iva.bz](https://iva.bz)
