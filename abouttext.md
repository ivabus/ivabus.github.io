Hi, I'm Ivan Bushchik. I live in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Currently, besides learning, I'm developing small projects and administrating homelab-like environment.

You can find some projects that I consider something important on the page [Projects](/projects). Or, if you want to see all the projects I've worked on, you should visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/ivabus).
