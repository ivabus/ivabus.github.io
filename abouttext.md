Hi there! My name is Ivan Bushchik and I'm 17 years old. I live in Saint Petersburg, Russia and I study system programming. In addition to studying, I also develop small projects and manage my homelab environment.

You can find some projects that I consider something important on the page [Projects](/projects). Or, if you want to see all the projects I've worked on, you should visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/ivabus).
